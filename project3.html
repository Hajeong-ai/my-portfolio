  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>The “Duo Mobile app Re-design project” aimed to enhance the user experience by simplifying and diversifying verification methods on Duo Mobile and through a new web interface. I identified user pain points through user research and testing to validate the improvements, resulting in a more seamless and satisfying user experience.</p>

      <section id="Background">
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Duo Mobile is a multifactor authentication app that provides additional security. Many universities use the Duo Mobile app to strengthen security through a second verification. Students verify their account in the Duo Mobile app by approving a push notification during their login process.</p>

  <h2>Researching Findings</h2>
  <p>
    After conducting direct interviews, I documented and analyzed the responses to identify insights and key findings.
    Using affinity diagramming, I organized these insights, focusing on three insights that highlight the user's pain points.
  </p>

  <div class="finding-points">
    <p><strong>1.</strong> Users use Duo Mobile very frequently, but they feel the current user flow is complex, leading to low satisfaction (5.8).</p>

    <p><strong>2.</strong> Users understand the need for second verification, but they want something <strong>quicker</strong> and <strong>easier</strong>.</p>

    <p><strong>3.</strong> Users want more <strong>diverse verification methods</strong> beyond phone number verification, as the lack of a clear user flow for changing phone numbers causes inconvenience.</p>
  </div>
</section>

      <section id="Research Questions">
        <h2>Research Questions</h2>
        <p>How can a redesigned Duo Mobile app deliver a faster, more seamless verification experience?</p>
        <p>How can we ensure that users have more diverse methods of accessing the Duo account, especially when they have problems with their mobile devices?</p>
      </section>

    <section id="Ideation">
        <h2>Ideation</h2>
        <p>Based on the findings from the interviews, ideation was conducted through Crazy 8's to come up with ways to improve user experience.</p>
      </section>

    <section id="Solution">
      <div class="solution-text">
        <h2>1. Sign-up Page (web)</h2>
        <p>The sign-up process enables users to include their phone numbers and email addresses on their accounts, which helps users when they face changes in their mobile devices.</p>

    <section id="Iterate & Test">
        <h2>Iterate & Test</h2>
        <h2>After re-designing using Figma, I conducted a user test with seven interviewees, asking them to conduct tasks corresponding to the three user flows.</h2>
        <p>UX research, ideation, wireframing, etc.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="Research Questions For the User Test">
    <h2>1. Does the re-designed Duo mobile app allow users to verify their accounts in an easier and faster way?</h2>
    <h2>2. Does Duo Web reduce user pain points when they change their phone number and try to log in to their school account?</h2>
    </section>

    <section id="User Test Results">
    <h2>User Test Results</h2>
    <p>1. User satisfaction with the current Duo was 5.8 on a scale of 1-10 which increased to 8.4 after completing tasks with the redesigned version — a 44.8% improvement.</p>
    <p>2. The task completion time for Task 2 was reduced by 8 seconds, dropping to 7 seconds compared to when using the current Duo Mobile app.</p>
    <p>3. The perceived ease of use improved from 3.8 to 4.6, reflecting a 21.1% increase.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="Reflection">
      <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
      <p>As an international student who frequently changes phone numbers, it was meaningful for me to understand the pain points of other students in the same situation and solve them through design.</p>
      <p>The Duo Mobile Re-design project gave me the opportunity to equip the skills needed to implement detailed interfaces and interactions using Figma.</p>
      <p>Conducting surveys with users taught me the importance of empathizing with users and understanding their pain points before initiating ideation.</p>
